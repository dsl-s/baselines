To run the baseline, you need to download the features here.

The shell script `get-features.sh` downloads all pre-extracted
features from [Zeondo](https://zenodo.org/record/7555151). You can
also manually download the files.

You can use these features for both open and closed tracks. You are
also welcome to download the audio data directly from
the [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) (CV)
project, and extract features you need. You can find a script for
downloading the CV data [here](../data).
