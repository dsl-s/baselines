To run the baseline, you need to download the features here.

The shell script `get-features.sh` downloads all pre-extracted
features from [Zeondo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7555150).
You can also manually download the files. The downloads will
require approximately 2G of space.

You can use these features for both open and closed tracks. You are
also welcome to download the audio data directly from
the [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) (CV)
project, and extract features you need. You can find a script for
downloading the CV data [here](../data).
